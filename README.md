[00:07.01] Somewhere beyond the sea
[00:12.72] Somewhere waiting for me
[00:17.83] My lover stands on golden sands
[00:22.80] And watches the ships that go sailing
[00:41.30] 
[00:29.28] Somewhere beyond the sea
[00:34.67] She's there watching for me
[00:39.66] If I could fly like birds on high
[00:44.41] Then straight to her arms I'll go sailing
[01:04.91] 
[00:50.94] It's far beyond the stars
[00:56.54] It's near beyond the moon
[01:02.06] I know beyond a doubt
[01:07.50] My heart will lead me there soon
[01:23.50] 
[01:12.98] We'll meet beyond the shore
[01:18.40] We'll kiss just as before
[01:23.40] Happy we'll be beyond the sea
[01:28.27] And never again I'll go sailing
[01:43.77] 
[02:06.05] I know beyond a doubt
[02:13.59] My heart will lead me there soon
[02:18.10] We'll meet, I know we'll meet beyond the shore
[02:24.54] We'll kiss just as before
[02:29.41] Happy we will be beyond the sea
[02:34.36] And never again I'll go sailing
[02:49.86] 
[02:42.79] No more sailing
[02:46.47] So long sailing, sailing
[02:49.60] No more sailing
[02:53.84] Goodbye, farewell, my friend
[02:57.41] No more sailing
[03:01.12] So long, sailing
[03:05.40] No more sailing
[03:10.11] No more, farewell
[03:15.72] Auf Wiedersehen
[03:23.22] 
[03:26.61] No more sailing
[03:30.24] No more
[03:31.95] Oh, no more sailing
[03:38.70] No more, no more
[03:44.83] No more sailing
[03:55.63] No more
[03:59.46] One more time
[04:02.72] No more sailing
